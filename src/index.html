            <h1>Uhm, what's that?</h1>
            <p>
                Good you're asking.
                <br>
                To get straight to the point, this dApp verifies that your Ethereum Account is acctually an EOA (or Externally Owned Account) and NOT a smart contract.
                Let that sink in for a moment.
                <br>

        <div class="text">
            <h1>Why build this tool?</h1>
            <p>
                Consider the following question: Does an address belong to some smart contract or to some EOA?
                We can tell them apart fairly easy (contacting/knowing the owner may be enough). 
                For other smart contracts, though, this is a tricky question to answer. 
                Solving said problem results in a more-complex-than-necessary user experience, as well as unnecessary burdens for developers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>What is this useful for?</h1>
            <p>
                Soulbound Tokens for example.
                <br>
                Suppose a token with a lock-up period after buying it.
                Next, let's assume that, instead of some user, a smart contract handles the buying process.
                Finally, we add some functionality to pass on the ownership of said smart contract to someone else.
                All of a sudden, our seemingly locked-up token becomes transferable again.
                <br>
                <br>
                Non transferable assets are only possible when smart contracts are banned from owning them. 
                Imagine one could buy a degree in some subject without first studying it.
                Sounds stupid, but is, at least without a system like Outsider, unavoidable on Ethereum.

            <h1>How does Outsider help?</h1>
            <p>
                To verify that some address is in fact an EOA, developers need to recover a public key from a so called ECDSA signature.
                While not as complicated as it sounds, such a procedure is not exactly trivial to implement. 
                <br>
                Outsider hides this logic and thereby reduces the difficulty to a singular, copy-and-pastable, line of code.
                <br>
                This means multiple things:
                <br>
                <br>
                A) (New) Users are a little bit less overwhelmed by all this arguably cryptic software.
                <br>
                <br>
                B) The end product is more secure.
                <br>
                <br>
                C) Developers can spend more time on actually building innovative software.
